## Cover letter

To the Editor,

Our paper will have a significant impact toward enabling optimal gas storage in
porous media. With over 200,000 cumulative papers published between 2003-2013
related to porous material such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) according to
ISI Web of Science, research interest in porous media is extremely high. A
major driving force in this interest is the application of MOFs in light
vehicle fuel storage. In 2011 alone, over $175 million was awarded for advanced
vehicle R&D. In addition, the storage and use of hydrogen in light vehicle fuel
tanks could help to mitigate climate change. The upper limit we provide
effectively rules out a significant direction of work towards the goal of
enabling alternative vehicular fuel storage, and thus should impact the funding
of research in this field.

The current version of the submitted paper contains approximately 3,000 words
with four moderate-size figures, which we are aware is still a bit long for
Nature. We have struggled to shorten the paper this much and have done so only
by moving major sections into the supplemental information. We are optimistic
that after review by referees we can identify additional content that can be
moved into the supplemental information to bring the paper down to 2,500 words.

Thank you for your consideration.

### NATURE IMPACT
> Although optional, the cover letter is an excellent opportunity to briefly

### NATURE WORD COUNT
> When submitting new or revised manuscripts, authors should state in a cover
> letter to the editor their rough estimate of the length of their paper in terms
> of word count and also anticipated number of pages of Nature. Authors of
> contributions that significantly exceed the limits stated here or specified by
> the editor will have to shorten their papers before acceptance, inevitably
> delaying publication.
