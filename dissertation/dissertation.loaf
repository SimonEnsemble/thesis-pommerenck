\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S1}{\ignorespaces Cartoon illustrating the definition of $\ensuremath {\Delta g_{st}}$ and a hypothetical experiment to measure it with a piston and removable barrier that separates two equal volumes, one with a porous material (bottom) and one with free space (top). The initial state (left) is a bulk gas phase at density $\rho $ and temperature $T$. An infinitely-thin, removable barrier separates the gas from the porous material (bottom). The barrier is then slowly removed, and the piston slowly pushes all gas molecules into the porous material in an isothermal process. The final state (right) is an adsorbed gas phase at density $\rho $ and temperature $T$.\relax }}{113}{figure.caption.166}%
